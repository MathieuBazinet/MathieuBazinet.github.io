Hi, my name is Mathieu Bazinet.

I am a computer science Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Pascal Germain, Ph.D.](https://www.pascalgermain.info/) et [Valentina Zantedeschi, Ph.D.](https://vzantedeschi.com/) in the [GRAIL lab](https://grail.ift.ulaval.ca/). 

I am mainly interested in statistical learning theory, with a focus on PAC-Bayes and sample compression theory, applied to deep learning and kernel methods.

I am responsible of the communications in the AI Club of Laval University ([CIAUL](https://cia.ift.ulaval.ca/)). I am responsible of the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Club-dintelligence-artificielle-de-lUniversit%C3%A9-Laval/100089798911416/) page, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cia-ulaval/) page and the [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ciaulaval/) page.

Fun facts about me : 
I got my karate black belt at age 14, and my second dan black belt at age 18. 

I have two cats, Baudelaire and Kanapé, named after the poets Charles Baudelaire and Natasha Kanapé-Fontaine. Baudelaire is a male *desert lynx* and Kanapé is (possibly) a female chartreux.

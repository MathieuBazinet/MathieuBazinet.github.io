Hi, my name is Mathieu Bazinet.

I am a computer science Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Pascal Germain, Ph.D.](https://www.pascalgermain.info/) et [Valentina Zantedeschi, Ph.D.](https://vzantedeschi.com/) in the [GRAIL lab](https://grail.ift.ulaval.ca/). 

I am mainly interested in statistical learning theory, with a focus on PAC-Bayes and sample compression theory applied to deep learning. While working on my master's degree, I was interested in kernel methods and wavelet transform. I also worked on regression trees for explaining physico-chemical processes linked to the migration of peptides through a ultrafiltration membrane.

I am director of the tutorials in the AI Club of Laval University ([CIAUL](https://cia.ift.ulaval.ca/)). You can find my tutorials [here](https://github.com/cia-ulaval/tutoriels-cia). Previously, I was director of communications for two years, where I created and animated the following social media pages : [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Club-dintelligence-artificielle-de-lUniversit%C3%A9-Laval/100089798911416/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cia-ulaval/) and the [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ciaulaval/).

Fun facts about me : 

I got my karate black belt at age 14 and my second dan black belt at age 18. 

I have two cats, Baudelaire and Kanapé, named after the poets Charles Baudelaire and Natasha Kanapé-Fontaine. Baudelaire is a male *desert lynx* and Kanapé is (possibly) a female chartreux.
